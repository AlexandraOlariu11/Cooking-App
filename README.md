# Cooking-App

This is a cooking application developed using React.js technology. The application includes a main page that showcases various types of dishes, a search bar for easy identification, and an option to add a favorite recipe. 
Each meal has a specific page containing the recipe and the necessary ingredients for its preparation. The data is extracted from an API. 
Unlike other projects, this one was developed in collaboration with the trainer from the Front-End Development course I completed.
